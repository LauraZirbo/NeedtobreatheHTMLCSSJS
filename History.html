    <h1>History</h1>
    <p> Brothers William Stanley "Bear" Rinehart III and Nathaniel 
            Bryant "Bo" Rinehart were raised in Possum Kingdom, South Carolina. 
            The brothers started performing in Seneca after moving there.
            The Rinehart brothers grew up at a church camp that their father, 
            who was a pastor, ran.

        </ul>
        <p>
            The brothers first performed in front of coffee 
            house audiences at Furman University, where Bear, who was named after
            University of Alabama football coach Bear Bryant, 
            was a wide receiver for the Furman Paladins football team, winning 
            the 2002 Banks McFadden trophy for South Carolina football player 
            of the year. After graduation, Bear, Bo and Joe Stillwell joined 
            with Seth Bolt, releasing independent albums that were recorded in
            Bolt's Plantation Studios.
